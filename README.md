# SendAm

WhatsApp-first payments powered by the Stellar network.

SendAm is a financial access MVP that lets people create a Stellar wallet, check their XLM balance, and send XLM using simple WhatsApp messages. The goal is to make blockchain payments feel as familiar as sending a chat message, especially for users who may not be comfortable with browser wallets, seed phrases, or exchange-style interfaces.

> Current status: MVP running on Stellar Testnet. This repository is not yet configured for real-money production use.

## Why SendAm

Many people already understand WhatsApp, but crypto wallets still feel technical, intimidating, and risky. SendAm bridges that gap by turning WhatsApp into a simple payment interface while using Stellar for fast, low-cost settlement.

The product is designed for users who need:

- A familiar way to interact with digital money.
- Low-cost cross-border value transfer.
- Wallet creation without installing a separate crypto app.
- A lightweight payment experience that works well on mobile.
- An admin dashboard for monitoring users, wallets, and transactions.

## Why Stellar

Stellar is a strong fit for SendAm because the product needs fast settlement, low fees, simple account primitives, and a network designed for payments. In the MVP, Stellar Testnet is used to:

- Generate Stellar keypairs for new users.
- Fund test wallets through Friendbot.
- Read native XLM balances through Horizon.
- Submit XLM payment transactions.
- Store transaction hashes for auditability and admin review.

The current implementation focuses on native XLM transfers first. The architecture can later support Stellar assets, anchors, fiat on/off ramps, and compliance-aware payment flows.

## Product Overview

SendAm has three main surfaces:

1. WhatsApp bot experience
   Users send natural commands to the bot, such as:

   ```text
   create wallet
   balance
   save ada GABC...
   contacts
   send 5 xlm ada
   send 5 xlm GABC...
   yes
   no
   help
   ```

2. REST API
   The backend exposes wallet and transaction endpoints so the product can be tested without WhatsApp.

3. Web admin dashboard
   Admins can view platform stats, users, wallets, and transaction records.

## Core Features

### User Features

- Create a Stellar Testnet wallet from a WhatsApp command.
- Automatically fund new test wallets using Stellar Friendbot.
- Check XLM balance by sending `balance`.
- Send XLM to another Stellar public address.
- Confirm transfers before funds are submitted to Stellar.
- Save contacts with aliases for repeat payments.
- Receive Stellar Expert receipt links after successful transfers.
- Receive simple WhatsApp replies for successful and failed actions.

### Admin Features

- View total users.
- View total wallets.
- View transaction counts.
- View successful and failed transactions.
- Browse user, wallet, and transaction tables.

### Developer Features

- REST endpoints for wallet creation, balance checks, and XLM transfers.
- MongoDB persistence for users, wallets, and transactions.
- Encrypted storage for Stellar secret keys.
- Separate backend and frontend apps in one monorepo.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Stellar SDK
- WhatsApp Business Cloud API
- Axios
- Helmet, CORS, Morgan, and rate limiting

### Frontend

- Next.js 14
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- Lucide React icons

### Blockchain

- Stellar Testnet
- Horizon API
- Native XLM payments
- Friendbot funding for test accounts

## How The Main Flow Works

### Wallet Creation

1. User sends `create wallet` on WhatsApp.
2. SendAm creates or finds the user by phone number.
3. Backend generates a Stellar keypair.
4. Secret key is encrypted before storage.
5. Public key is stored on the wallet record.
6. Testnet wallet is funded with Friendbot.
7. User receives their public key by WhatsApp.

### Balance Check

1. User sends `balance`.
2. Backend finds the user's wallet.
3. Backend loads the account from Stellar Horizon.
4. User receives current native XLM balance.

### XLM Transfer

1. User sends a command like `send 5 xlm GABC...` or `send 5 xlm ada`.
2. Backend parses amount and destination, or resolves a saved contact alias.
3. Backend sends a confirmation prompt to the user.
4. User replies `YES` to approve or `NO` to cancel.
5. Backend decrypts the user's stored Stellar secret key.
6. Backend builds, signs, and submits a Stellar payment transaction.
7. Transaction result and Stellar Expert receipt link are saved in MongoDB.
8. User receives success or failure feedback on WhatsApp.

## API Summary

## Security Notes

This project is still an MVP. Before any production or real-money launch, the following must be completed:

- Replace mock admin authentication with real backend authentication.
- Protect admin API routes with server-side authorization.
- Remove any fallback encryption key behavior.
- Validate Stellar public keys, amounts, phone numbers, and command payloads.
- Add transaction limits and abuse prevention.
- Add audit logs for sensitive actions.
- Add secure secret management for deployment.
- Complete legal, compliance, KYC, AML, and custody review where required.

## Current Limitations

- Uses Stellar Testnet only.
- Supports native XLM transfers only.
- WhatsApp command parser is intentionally simple.
- Admin login is currently mock/demo logic.
- No customer web signup is required yet because WhatsApp phone number is the MVP identity.
- No production compliance workflow is included yet.

## Roadmap

### MVP Completion

- Real admin authentication.
- Stronger validation for wallet and payment requests.
- Better WhatsApp command handling, confirmation prompts, and error messages.
- Automated tests for parser, wallet, webhook, and transaction flows.
- Deployment configuration for backend, frontend, database, and environment variables.

### Stellar Product Expansion

- Support custom Stellar assets.
- Expand contact aliases into richer recipient management.
- Add richer transaction receipts with Stellar explorer links.
- Add QR-code public key sharing.
- Add low-balance warnings and safer confirmation flows.
- Explore anchor integrations for fiat on/off ramps.

### Production Readiness

- Compliance review.
- Monitoring and alerting.
- Admin roles and permissions.
- Recovery and support workflows.
- Rate limits per user and per phone number.
- Secure key-management strategy.

## Reviewer's Summary

SendAm demonstrates a practical Stellar use case: making blockchain payments accessible through a communication channel people already use every day. The MVP combines WhatsApp, Stellar Testnet, MongoDB, and a Next.js admin dashboard to show the foundation for a chat-based payment product.

The project is intentionally scoped: it proves wallet creation, balance checks, saved recipients, confirmation-based XLM transfers, and auditable Stellar receipts first. With stronger authentication, validation, compliance work, and production deployment, SendAm can evolve from a Testnet MVP into a broader payments product for mobile-first users.
